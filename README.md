# Access Modifiers in Java
In Java, access modifiers are keywords that set the accessibility (or visibility) of classes, methods, and other members. They control where a particular class, method, or variable can be accessed from. There are four primary access modifiers in Java:
<br>
Public: Use when you want the member to be accessible from any other class.
<br>
Protected: Use when you want the member to be accessible within the package and by subclasses.
<br>
Default: Use when you want the member to be accessible only within the same package.
<br>
Private: Use when you want the member to be accessible only within the class it is declared.
